# Automatic colorization autoencoder 
We're now going to work on another practical application of autoencoders. In this case, we're going to imagine that we have a grayscale photo and that we want to build a tool that will automatically add color to it. We would like to replicate the human abilities in identifying that the sea and sky are blue, the grass field and trees are green, while the clouds are white, and so on.
